# DrawWithFriends — website files

This set contains a simple, original landing site for DrawWithFriends:
- index.html — main landing page and frontend room UI shell
- privacy.html — privacy policy page
- support.html — support / contact page
- styles.css — site styling
- (small inline scripts in index.html for modal/demo actions)

How to add to your repo
1. Copy these files into the repository root (or into a docs/ folder for GitHub Pages).
2. Open index.html locally to preview.
3. To publish on GitHub Pages, place files in docs/ and enable Pages from main/docs or use your preferred deployment.

Notes
- These are frontend-only starter pages. Replace alerts in index.html with navigation and integrate a backend (Node/socket.io, serverless, or other) for real-time sync.
- Update contact email and copy where needed.
